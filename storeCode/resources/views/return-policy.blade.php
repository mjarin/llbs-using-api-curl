    <p style="text-align:justify;">At taiba Fun Craft, we understand that sometimes, the product you receive may not be exactly what you ordered. That’s why we have a very flexible Return & Exchange policy.
If you are not satisfied with your product/order, you can easily request a return/exchange. <br>  However, there are a few rules you need to keep in mind:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In cases of quality, size, color or design mismatch, missing/damaged/wrong items/parts, taiba Fun Craft will bear the delivery cost for return and exchange.</li>
                <li>In cases where you have simply changed your mind or ordered the wrong item, the customer will bear the delivery cost for return and exchange.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-3" style="text-align:justify;">All return/exchange requests have to be raised within three days of delivery. Additionally, the product has to be in its original and unused state in order to be eligible for a return/exchange.
            We hope this policy provides you with the peace of mind that you will receive the best possible products and services from taiba Fun Craft!</p>
